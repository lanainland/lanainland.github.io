**Serves 8**

## Ingredients

- 1 - 1 1/2 cup warm water
- 1/2 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp vinegar
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 cups white flour (or substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for a more rustic flavour)
- 1/2 cup of any combination of seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, chia or linseeds)

## Instructions

1. Mix yeast, sugar and water and let sit for 5 minutes.
2. Add olive oil and vinegar and mix.
3. Combine flour and salt separately and add to the yeast mixture gradually.
4. Add in seeds and mix well. The dough should be very sticky and wet at this point.
5. Cover and let rise at room temperature for at least an hour (or in the fridge overnight for bigger air pockets).
6. Place dough on a well floured surface and fold it over several times - no need to knead!
7. Once it is well coated with flour, shape dough into a ball.

There are two methods for baking:

8. Place a Dutch oven or an oven proof pot with a lid in your oven and heat to 200 C.
9. Take the pot out of the oven and place the dough inside. Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
10. Remove lid and bake for another 15 minutes.

Or:

8. Preheat oven to 230Â°C.
9. Transfer the dough onto an oven tray lined with baking paper and place a water filled tray below. 
10. Bake for 45 minutes.

Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and let cool slightly before cutting.
