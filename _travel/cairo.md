The most interesting place to visit in Cairo is by far the Cairo Museum. It houses an extensive collection of mummies, sarcophagi and all sorts of objects from the ancient Egyptian period up to the Roman era. Not to mention some of the treasures found in the tomb of the famous Pharaoh -  Tutankhamun.

Perhaps some of the most beautiful moments in Cairo happen after nightfall. The city comes alive as the sun comes down and every sacred building is wrapped up in lights. They sparkle like jewels in the vastness of the night.
