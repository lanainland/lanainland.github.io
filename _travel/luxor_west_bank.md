## A multitude of magnificent monuments - Temple of Hatshepsut

Sand, dust and rock...in the midst of a barren and monotone landscape emerges this majestic structure built for Egypt's legendary Pharaoh queen Hatshepsut.

The entire structure is built out of local limestone to blend with the mountainous landscape.

Square columns with statues of the queen depicted as a man.

Sanctuary of Amun - the chamber is cut directly into the mountain and is the heart of the temple. It has the most beautiful light that comes in through a small window revealing an amazing blue ceiling.

There is a magical, mystical feeling about being in this land of immortal pharaohs.

## Colossal columns and cool carvings - Temple of Rameses III

Covered in carvings that tell real stories and giant columns depicting the man itself, this mortuary temple is a gem of Egyptian art and architecture.

It has some of the best preserved reliefs in original colours. The blue is still incredibly vivid.

Gigantic square columns of the Pharaoh himself.

The interior courtyard is lined with cut off columns.

The outer walls are covered in hieroglyphs.
