## Temple of Hatshepsut

Sand, dust and rock...in the midst of a barren and monotone landscape emerges this majestic structure built for Egypt's legendary Pharaoh queen Hatshepsut.

The entire structure is built out of local limestone to blend with the mountainous landscape. It has three levels and colonnades with square pillars.

Sanctuary of Amun - the chamber is cut directly into the mountain and is the heart of the temple. It has the most beautiful light that comes in through a small window revealing an amazing blue ceiling.

## Temple of Rameses III

Covered in carvings that tell real stories and giant columns depicting the man itself, this mortuary temple is a gem of Egyptian art and architecture.

From a distance the temple merges with the landscape but as we approach, the amount of detail becomes apparent.

The main interior courtyard has gigantic square columns of the Pharaoh himself and some of the best preserved carvings in original colours. Every part of this structure is covered in reliefs. If walls could speak...

The last courtyard is filled with cut off columns - they are the remains of a grand hypostyle hall. A reminder of what once was and will never be...

 There is a magical, mystical feeling about being in this land of immortal pharaohs.
