## Cinque Terre

Colourful buildings overlooking turquoise waters with fishing boats...sounds like a definition of a postcard, and that is what it feels like to stroll through these picturesque villages.

## Genova

Authentic and unpretentious, this city has a 'real' feel. No tourist crowds and no fuss, the city can just be enjoyed as is and there are plenty of interesting nooks and crannies to explore.

Abandoned due to an Earthquake in 1887, this hilltop village was rediscovered and taken over by artists in the 1960s. An incredible place to visit!
