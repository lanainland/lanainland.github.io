A ghostly apparition or a lamp?

I found this translucent mannequin body just lying on the street outside of a boutique in Barcelona. I thought I would save it and gave it new life as a lamp.

I used an old floor lamp base and cut a wood insert to attach the bulb and connect it to the 'body'. With some cleaning and drilling it was ready to 'glow'!
