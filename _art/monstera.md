Study of a Monstera plant in watercolour. Monsteras - or Swiss Cheese plants -  are tropical plants that grow aerial roots to attach themselves to trees and climb up towards the light. Older plants have fenestrated large leaves. Above is the underside of a young leaf showing its venation structure.
