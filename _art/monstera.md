There is so much to love about a Monstera, also known as a Swiss cheese plant. Starting with its most obvious feature -  the striking fenestrated leaves. As the plant matures it develops larger leaves with more fenestration. Above is the underside of a young leaf depicting its venation structure.

Monsteras also have very cool aerial roots that look like spider legs. They attach themselves to trees and climb up towards the light. This is the feature that caught my attention and I wanted to examine it further.

They also make great houseplants - easy to care for and just great to look at.
