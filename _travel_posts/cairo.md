The most interesting place to visit in Cairo is by far the Cairo Museum. It houses an extensive collection of mummies, sarcophagi and all sorts of objects from the ancient Egyptian period up to the Roman era. Not to mention some of the treasures found in the tomb of the famous Pharaoh - Tutankhamun.

The building itself has a particular charm and evokes an era of archeological discoveries, with European style architecture and antique furniture.

The museum displays an overwhelming quantity of sarcophagi, they are well preserved and each have specific decorative elements.

After Tutankhamun, the most well known sarcophagi in the museum are those of the royalty couple Yuya and Tuya. The discovery of their tomb was one of the most important archeological findings in the early 20th century. Their mummies are also displayed in the museum.

Perhaps some of the most beautiful moments in Cairo happen after nightfall. The city comes alive as the sun comes down and every sacred building is wrapped up in lights. They sparkle like jewels in the vastness of the night.

A more realistic version of Cairo during the daytime tells a different story. A non-stop flow of cars, bikes and people, all of whom are incredibly busy and in a hurry to get somewhere. It all somehow works in the end!
