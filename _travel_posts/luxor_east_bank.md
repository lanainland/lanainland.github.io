## Karnak Temple

When visiting Luxor, one simply cannot miss this marvel of ancient Egypt!
An avenue adorned with ram headed sphinxes greets the visitor approaching the temple. They feel almost alive!

As we walk further to the heart of the temple we find the pièce de résistance - a hypostyle hall that is no more. The massive columns that once held a ceiling still stand, towering over everything and everyone in their presence.

#### The Great Hypostyle hall lined with columns

The main hall has a total of 134 sandstone columns, each over 20 meters tall. Columns are completely covered with carvings and some of the original paint is still visible.

#### Relief covered columns

There are also some giant statues of Rameses III. This guy had style! His tomb and his temple have some of the best carvings and overall designs.

## Luxor highlights

Crossing the Nile on a local ferry is definitely an adventure. Watching people going about their usual business without any pretense felt like a glimpse into their reality.

After a long day of sightseeing, the best reward is to sit in an atmospheric restaurant and relax with some amazing food. It is surprisingly hard to find good food without some intensive research, but this was hands down the best meal we had in Egypt!
