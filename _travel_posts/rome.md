Italy is one of those countries where every place and every corner feels like a picture. This is especially true for Rome. It doesn’t matter where you turn - whether it’s the amazing architecture, the variety of details or simply the way the light hits at just the perfect angle - all pictures somehow turn out great!

There is so much to see and do in Rome, so much history. It is by far one of my favourite cities in Europe. I had a really hard time deciding which photos to pick so here are my favourite moments.
